## 1. Project Overview

QBuild is a tool developed to audit, analyze, and test smart contracts written in C++ within the Qubic ecosystem. Its artificial intelligence engine detects code vulnerabilities, offers concrete recommendations, and automatically generates tests, making it easier to comprehensively validate smart contracts before their deployment on the blockchain.

QBuild’s main value lies in its ease of use (“one-click audit and test”) and its ability to democratize advanced auditing in a Web3 environment using C++, which is traditionally more complex. It is an internationally recognized, cloud-hosted platform that enhances the security and quality of Qubic developments, aimed at both developers and businesses seeking robustness in their decentralized applications.

### 1.1 Example Use Case - Generation of a New Dapp

A typical use case for QBuild involves a development team creating a new smart contract for the Qubic platform. Before deploying the contract on the main network, the team uses QBuild to perform an automated audit that detects critical vulnerabilities and security risks in the code. The tool not only identifies potential flaws but also automatically generates tests that simulate real attacks, allowing the team to validate the contract’s resilience in a safe and controlled environment.

After implementing the improvements recommended by QBuild, the smart contract becomes more robust and secure, minimizing the risk of costly errors or exploits once deployed. In this way, QBuild significantly accelerates the development cycle, reduces manual audit costs, and fosters trust both internally and within the Qubic user and validator community. This facilitates the adoption of new projects that leverage the unique capabilities of the Qubic blockchain.

### 1.2 Example User Workflow

- Upload the C++ contract files (.h/.cpp)
- Automatic AI-driven analysis (2–3 minutes)
- Generation of security report
- Review of detected vulnerabilities and test cases
- Export of results

## 2. Scope of the Proposal

Our proposal for joining the Qubic incubation program is to develop an initial version of QBuild focused on automating the auditing, analysis, and testing of smart contracts written in C++ on the Qubic blockchain. This platform will allow developers and users to upload their smart contract code, automatically detect vulnerabilities using AI-powered analysis and generate corresponding test cases.

This initial QBuild version will also include a web-based user interface where users can easily upload C++ smart contract files, configure audit parameters, review AI-generated reports, and launch test executions—all through an intuitive and accessible panel.

The scope of the proposal includes developing all core functionalities necessary for fully automated C++ contract audits within the Qubic ecosystem. This encompasses integrating static analysis, vulnerability detection and automated test generation, all accessible via a user-friendly web dashboard. Our objective is to deliver a robust, scalable, and intuitive platform that simplifies the smart contract auditing process for both individual developers and enterprise teams. By combining cutting-edge AI with practical development workflows, QBuild aims to set a new standard of security and efficiency for Qubic smart contracts, paving the way for broader adoption and ongoing innovation across the ecosystem.

In upcoming strategic projects for the Qubic ecosystem, the development of a specialized language model that natively understands Qubic is planned, based on fine-tuning an LLM. This project will include an automated training pipeline, a community-driven collaborative learning system, and advanced zero-prompt analysis capabilities, ensuring complete independence from external models. The technical implementation involves optimized platforms for training and local deployment, supported by a multidisciplinary team focused on backend, ML/AI, frontend, and DevOps.

**Qbuild 3.0: built-in testnet:**
This version will focus on real vulnerability validation through the integration of nodes in the Qubic testnet. This includes deploying nodes via Docker, contract deployment and execution under real conditions, along with live performance metrics and transaction analysis. Developer experience will be enhanced with tools like VSCode extensions and CI/CD plugins, and a public API will be provided for third-party integrations, enabling robust testing and improved security and performance analysis of the network.

We believe this roadmap represents a solid step forward toward advanced integration and practical validation in the blockchain space, combining specialized artificial intelligence with powerful developer tools, laying strong foundations for the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.

The future development of this roadmap is subject to the submission of corresponding proposals for Qbuild 2.0 and/or 3.0 and the approval of the necessary funding for its implementation.
